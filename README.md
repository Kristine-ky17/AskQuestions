# AskQuestions

### This is a project that was done during a 2-day hackathon held by BuildingBlocs 2024 by Group I6!

In this project, we aimed to modify a typical forum posting website by adding features such as a log-in system, filter and 'star' function to it. 
By doing so, students accessing the forum page can then save questions that would be helpful/useful for them and filter for similar questions instead of scrolling through and reading each question to find a similar asked question or resort to repeating a similar question that was already asked!

## The filter function currently only allows for filtering by topics and the log-in registration function is currently not functional!
For anyone who is interested in trying out the other functions, you may log in via the provided user name and password:
