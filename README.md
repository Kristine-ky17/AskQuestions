# AskQuestions

### This is a project that was done during a 2-day hackathon held by BuildingBlocs 2024 by Group I6!

In this project, we aimed to modify a typical forum posting website by adding features such as a log-in system, filter and 'star' function to it. 
By doing so, students accessing the forum page can then save questions that would be helpful/useful to them and filter for similar questions instead of either scrolling through and reading each question to find a previously asked question and response that answers their question or resorting to asking a simlar a question that has already been asked by other students!

**Currently, the filter function currently only allows for filtering by topics and the log-in registration function is not fully functional!**
**Please refresh the page and log in again to see a new question you have just asked in the forum**
For anyone who is interested in trying out the other functions, you may log in via the provided user name and password:
